Neural Field Simulator

The Neural Field Simulator computes activity numerically in
2-dimensional neural fields by solving integral-differential equations
involving transmission delays and visualizes the spatio-temporal
activity.

To use the simulator please see the documentation in this archive
under the folder:

nfSimulator_2.3.4/documentation/index.html

Any questions, comments, bugs etc... can be sent to Eric at
